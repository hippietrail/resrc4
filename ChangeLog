ReSrc4 v2.1 ( 18-Oct-2023 )

- Rewrote the code, so it portable and works on little endian machines.

- First release of source code under GPL v3.


ReSrc4 v2.2 ( 20-Oct-2023 )

- If a jmp/jsr tries to jump outside Hunk file Memory area, a warning will
 be printed.. Instead of triggering an error during Trace.

- Removed unistd.h include file and the single access() function.. Now it
 should be fully standard c library.

- Makefile will default to Linux envirement compile.


ReSrc4 v2.3 ( 29-Oct-2023 )

- Added support for many FPU opcodes and a few more Integer opcodes.

- Added support for many standard library calls.

- Fixed a tracing error where registers was not cleared after jsr/bsr calls.

- I had a test file where 3 labels had the same name but in diffrent
  objects/section. So now there are a label check for names collision.

- Rewrote the Jump Table detector.


ReSrc4 v2.4 ( 04-Feb-2024 )

- Fixed SegFaults in Hash Lookup functions. Changed them to work as unsigned
  integers, as negative values would result in a crash.


ReSrc4 v2.5 ( 12-Feb-2024 )

- Added support for Addx, Subx and Negx.

- Added support for 020 Addressing modes. It uses vasm syntax.

- Fixed: A BSS entry could be marks as String data. That would 
  result in a change from ds.b to dc.b, but not any more.

- Added: support for FMove to handle fpiar/fpsr/fpcr regs.

- Fixed: FNeg had the correct bit mask but called the wrong
  function. So it became a FSub instead.

- Added: 3 new jump tables and fixed one with a Mask error.

ReSrc4 v2.8 ( 29-Jul-2024 )

- Updated Hunk File parser. It can now handle strcutures where you get
  two or more HUNK_END in a row.

- Added a simply filename check at startup, so Input and Output filename
  are not the same, to avoid overwriting.. but its only a simply strcmp().

- Changed Makefile so it no longer creates a .map file on compile.
